Findings:

Pros (especially compared to other cross platform methods):
    General:
        - Setup is easy
        - Code sharing easy
        - One can share almost everything (business logic)
            - Database -> SqlDelight
            - Networking -> Ktor
            - General Business logic
        - Platform specific implementations are easy
            - using expect/actual
            - using interfaces and providers
        - (Dependency Injection possible)
            - using koin
            - using kodein (only iOS and android)
        - The idea is to only share business logic and not ui stuff
            - leveraging the platform specific strenghts regarding ui
            - complete freedom in ui design (within platform specifig boundaries)
        
        - Future:
            - Kotlin 1.4
                - Multithreaded coroutines on native
                - new kotlin compiler
                    - one compiler for all targets
                    - faster build speeds on native 
            - iOS development plugin for Android studio
                - run, debug, test code
                - simulators
        

    Android:
        - Almost the same as when developing a normal app
        - Performance the same
        - enforces separation of business logic and ui logic
        - debugging is the same
        - app size is the same
        - build time the same
    
    iOS:
        - easy to use kotlin code from swift
        - all important platform libs have a kotlin binding (like: dispatch_queues)

Cons:
    General:
        - not many well known libraries
            - especially for networking and Database. There the only real options are Ktor and SqlDelight

    Android:
        - One has to pay attention for objects which are being frozen on native. Something that works on android does not necessarily work on native
        - not that many libs for simple stuff like UUID


    iOS:
        - Hard to debug
            - either use a xcode plugin
            - or use the command line
        - freezing
        - memory model
        - binary incompatibility between kotlin versions
            - especially hurtful when having many third party libs
        - build times
        - coroutines are single threaded only
        - stacktraces are good but a bit harder to read compared to "plain" jvm kotlin
